# 2D-Rasterizer
Framework for a basic 2D rasterizer in C++

Rasterizer Tasks:
- Bresenham Line-Drawing Algorithm
- Colour Interpolation (for drawing & filling)
- Variety of Line Patterns and Thickness
- Alpha blending
- Circle Drawing
- Complex Polygon drawing (comvex & concave)
- Scanline filling
- Partial clipping

Test the solution with the executable. 
Tests using keys F1 - F8.
See code for further comments

An incomplete executable has also been added for comparison for when I only had 
a window without the features implemented.
